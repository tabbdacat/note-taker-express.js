# Note Taker - Express.js

## Description

This application is a useful tool to store notes of your choosing to store items you need to complete, information you may need to access later, or whatever you wish to keep posted. 

While developing this website, I learned about using Express.js, including how this framework can help build multi-page applications and manage servers. I gained experience working with processing GET and POST requests between the frontend and the backend.

## Usage

Once viewing the website, you can clock the "Get Started" button to access your saved notes, along with input fields Title and Text for a new note. Click the Save icon to store your note to the JSON file on the backend.
